**Use Case**: Learning resource for developers creating or customizing agents

### 2. Example Agent Configurations (3 files)

#### examples/fundamentals_analyst.agent.md
**Agent Type**: Analyst (Rule-based)

**Strategy**: Analyzes fundamental financial metrics to identify companies with strong profitability, growth, financial health, and reasonable valuations

**Key Features**:
- 4 analysis categories: Profitability, Growth, Financial Health, Valuation
- 17-point scoring system

- 3 detailed examples: Strong fundamentals (AAPL), Weak fundamentals (hypothetical), Mixed signals (hypothetical)

**Metrics**:
- Profitability: ROE, Net Margin, Operating Margin
- Growth: Revenue Growth, EPS Growth, Book Value Growth
- Financial Health: Current Ratio, Debt/Equity, FCF/EPS
- Valuation: P/E, P/B, P/S ratios

**Implementation Reference**: `src/agents/fundamentals.py`

#### examples/warren_buffett.agent.md
**Agent Type**: Investor (LLM-powered)

**Strategy**: Emulates Warren Buffett's value investing philosophy - seeks wonderful companies at fair prices with durable moats, excellent management, and margin of safety

**Key Features**:
- 6 analysis categories totaling 52 quantitative points
- LLM integration for qualitative reasoning
- Intrinsic value calculation using owner earnings method
- Circle of competence filtering
- 3 detailed examples: Coca-Cola (bullish), Tesla (neutral/outside competence), Troubled bank (bearish)

**Metrics**:
- Fundamental Quality: ROE, margins, debt, liquidity (10 pts)

- Competitive Moat: Brand, network effects, cost advantages (18 pts)
- Management Quality: Capital allocation, integrity (9 pts)
- Pricing Power: Gross margins (5 pts)
- Book Value Growth: CAGR (5 pts)

**Implementation Reference**: `src/agents/warren_buffett.py`

#### examples/risk_manager.agent.md
**Agent Type**: Manager

**Strategy**: Portfolio-level risk management - aggregates signals from all agents, calculates position sizes based on consensus and volatility, enforces diversification limits

**Key Features**:
- Consensus-based signal aggregation
- Volatility-adjusted position sizing
- Sector concentration limits (max 25% per sector)
- Dynamic position sizing formula with multiple factors
- Stop loss calculations
- 4 detailed examples: High conviction/low risk, High volatility, Sector limits, Bearish consensus

**Analysis Factors**:
- Signal Consensus (40% weight): Agreement across agents
- Volatility Analysis (30% weight): Risk adjustment based on historical volatility
- Sector Concentration (15% weight): Diversification enforcement
- Confidence-Weighted Score (15% weight): Average agent confidence

**Position Sizing Formula**:
```
Final Position = Base × Consensus × Risk Factor × Confidence × Sector Adjustment
```

**Implementation Reference**: `src/agents/risk_manager.py`

### 3. Supporting Documentation

#### README.md
**Purpose**: Entry point and navigation for the agent documentation

**Key Content**:
- Documentation structure overview
- Quick start guides for different user types
- Agent type comparison table
- Agent workflow diagram
- Common use cases with recommendations
- Validation checklist
- Testing instructions
- Customization guidance
- Contribution guidelines
- Troubleshooting quick reference

## Documentation Statistics

- **Total Files**: 6 (2 core docs + 3 examples + 1 README + 1 summary)
- **Total Lines**: ~3,500 lines of comprehensive documentation
- **Examples Provided**: 10 detailed scenarios across 3 agents
- **Agent Types Covered**: All 3 types (Analyst, Investor, Manager)
- **Sections per Agent**: 9 required + optional sections
- **Metrics Documented**: 30+ financial and risk metrics

## Key Concepts Introduced

### Agent Markdown Specification (v1.0)
A standardized format for defining trading agents using Markdown with YAML front matter. Enables:
- Human-readable agent definitions
- Version control friendly
- Self-documenting strategies
- Automated validation
- Easy sharing and collaboration

### Signal Format Standard
```json
{
  "TICKER": {
    "signal": "bullish|bearish|neutral",
    "confidence": 0-100,
    "reasoning": {
      "category": {
        "signal": "...",
        "confidence": 0-100,
        "metrics": {...},
        "details": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent Type Taxonomy
1. **Analyst Agents**: Fast, quantitative, rule-based
2. **Investor Agents**: Slower, qualitative, LLM-powered
3. **Manager Agents**: Aggregation, risk management, portfolio-level

## Use Cases

### For Developers
- **Creating New Agents**: Follow AGENT_GUIDE.md tutorial
- **Validating Agents**: Use AGENT_SPEC.md validation rules
- **Understanding Existing Agents**: Read example `.agent.md` files
- **Debugging**: Reference troubleshooting section in AGENT_GUIDE.md

### For Researchers
- **Strategy Documentation**: Use specification to document investment strategies
- **Backtesting**: Configure agents for historical performance analysis
- **Strategy Comparison**: Document multiple strategies in consistent format

### For Users
- **Understanding Decisions**: Read agent reasoning in examples
- **Customization**: Adjust thresholds and weights based on risk tolerance
- **Agent Selection**: Choose which agents to enable/disable

## Integration with Existing Codebase

This documentation complements the existing Python implementation:

- **Specification matches implementation**: Agent structure in docs reflects `src/agents/*.py`
- **Examples document actual agents**: Each example corresponds to a real Python agent
- **Signal format is consistent**: JSON structure matches actual output format
- **Can guide future development**: Specification can drive agent parser/loader implementation

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the documentation:

1. **Agent Validation Script**: Automated checker for `.agent.md` files
2. **Agent Generator**: CLI tool to scaffold new agents from templates
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track agent accuracy and contribution
4. **Interactive Explorer**: Web UI to browse and compare agents
5. **More Examples**: Additional investor agents (Graham, Lynch, Fisher, etc.)
6. **Multi-language Support**: Translate specifications and guides
7. **Video Tutorials**: Screen recordings of agent creation process
